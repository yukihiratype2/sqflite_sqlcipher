# sqflite_sqlcipher

This is a fork from the plugin [sqflite](https://github.com/tekartik/sqflite).  **Up to date with version 1.2.1**

This fork adds an optional parameter "password" to open encrypted databases. Everything else behaves like the `sqflite` plugin, same API.

The SQLCipher version of the plugin is 4.10. If you try to open a database encrypted with a lower version of SQLCipher, the plugin will try to migrate it to a new version using the operation `PRAGMA cipher_migrate` (This automatic migration to version 4 is only done in Android. PR welcome for this feature in iOS).

### Install

To add it in your project include this in the `pubspec.yml`.
```
dependencies:
  sqflite: (whichever since it will be overriden with this fork)

dependency_overrides:
  sqflite:
    git:
      url: https://www.github.com/davidmartos96/sqflite_sqlcipher.git
      path: sqflite
      ref: a62f579040c5faa0645683e0b10a4f15484bf2f3
```
Dependency overrides are used to avoid conflict with other projects that depend on "normal" sqflite. For example https://github.com/renefloor/flutter_cache_manager

### iOS
**REQUIRED:** Include this in your iOS `Podfile`
```
pod 'SQLCipher', '~>4.1.0'
```
If you try to use a database encrypted with a SqlCipher version lower than 4, the version in the Podfile can be changed to a lower one `'~>3.4.2'`. But note that if doing that, the running database on Android will be version 4 (since it migrates automatically) and on iOS will be version 3.

### Android
If using ProGuard, add the following rules:
```
-keep class net.sqlcipher.** { *; }
-keep class net.sqlcipher.database.* { *; }
```
