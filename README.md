# sqflite_sqlcipher

This is a fork from the plugin [sqflite](https://github.com/tekartik/sqflite).  **Up to date with version 1.1.7+1**

This fork adds an optional parameter "password" to open encrypted databases.

The SQLCipher version of the plugin is 4.10. If you try to open a database encrypted with a lower version of SQLCipher, the plugin will try to migrate it to a new version using the operation `PRAGMA cipher_migrate`.

To add it in your project include this in the `pubspec.yml`.
```
